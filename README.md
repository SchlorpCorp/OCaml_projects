When executed, this program prompts player 1 to enter their number, then repeatedly prompts player 2 to guess players 1's number, returning "Too high" if the guess is too high and "Too low" if the guess is to low.

After each guess, player 2 will also be informed about how many guesses they have made.

The total number of guesses made will be output once player 2 guesses the correct number.
